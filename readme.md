1.8

This is a port of the code by Matt Hagerty and AsmusR designed to run the update entirely on the GPU, delegating only the data loading to the host system. The host side here is written in C and loads from a Megacart-based bank-switched ROM cartridge. It has been tested to work using the AtariMax SD multicart.
